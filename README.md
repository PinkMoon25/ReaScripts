### REAPER Script: Reorder Tracks by Name ðŸŽ¶

This REAPER script automatically reorders tracks in your project based on a predefined sequence of track names. It identifies the tracks by their names, selects them, and moves them to the desired position in the Track Control Panel (TCP).

### Features:
- Customizable track order: Modify the `trackOrder` variable to set your preferred track arrangement.
- Skips child tracks to prevent unintended reordering.
- Automatically adjusts the TCP layout after reordering.

Great for organizing large sessions and keeping your project neat and consistent!
